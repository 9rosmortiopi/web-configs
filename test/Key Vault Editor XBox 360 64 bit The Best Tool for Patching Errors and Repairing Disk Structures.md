## What You Need
 
Before you start using Key Vault Editor, you need to have the following things:
 
- A modded Xbox 360 that can run unsigned code. This can be done by installing a custom firmware (CFW) or an exploit such as JTAG or RGH.
- A way to dump your NAND flash memory from your Xbox 360. This can be done by using a hardware device such as a NAND-X or a JR Programmer, or by using software such as XeLL or Flash360.
- A way to obtain your CPU key from your Xbox 360. This is a unique 32-digit hexadecimal code that is required to decrypt and encrypt your NAND image. You can get it by using XeLL or by reading it from your console's fuses.
- A copy of Key Vault Editor for Xbox 360. You can download it from [here](https://www.360-hq.com/xbox360-homebrew-80-KeyVault_Modder.html). It is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 (32-bit and 64-bit).
- A backup of your original NAND image and KV file. This is very important in case something goes wrong and you need to restore your console to its original state.

## How to Use Key Vault Editor
 
Once you have everything ready, you can follow these steps to use Key Vault Editor:

1. Launch Key Vault Editor on your PC and click on the "Open File" button. Browse to the location of your NAND image file and select it. It should have a .bin extension.

4. When you are done editing your KV, click on the "Encrypt" button. The program will encrypt your KV file and insert it back into your NAND image.
5. Click on the "Save File" button and choose a location and name for your modified NAND image file. Make sure you don't overwrite your original NAND image file.
6. Write your modified NAND image back to your Xbox 360 using the same method you used to dump it. Be careful not to brick your console by writing a corrupted or incompatible NAND image.
7. Turn on your Xbox 360 and enjoy the changes you made to your KV.
